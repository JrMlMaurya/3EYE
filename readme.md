# Background Generation with Diffusion Model Inpainting

This project implements a background generation system using a diffusion-based inpainting model. It allows users to upload images and generate new backgrounds by modifying the original image's background while preserving the foreground. This is particularly useful for creating new scenes or adjusting backgrounds while maintaining the integrity of the main subject.

## Features
- Background removal using a mask.
- Background regeneration with diffusion inpainting.
- Adjustable inpainting parameters for fine-tuning the results.
